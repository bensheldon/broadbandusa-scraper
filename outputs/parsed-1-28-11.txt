(CDL) Mississippi Broadband Adoption and Sustainability initiative will serve forty two (42) counties (over half of the state) including one hundred and fifty six (156) communities which are rural and broadband underserved, and the processes that will be used by CDL in the administration of the project over a three year period are designed to produce a sustainable increase in demand for and subscribership to broadband services. CDL is a non-governmental educational organization, headquartered in Mississippi, with the core mission of community and economic development, including its national economic development initiative known as 'Cog-ville&quot;. CDL brings a track record and management team needed to facilitate trust and understanding, and efficiently stimulate the demand for broadband, economic growth, and job creation. CDL has been pioneering in this broadband adoption arena in Mississippi for several years, and it has been CDL&#039;s experience that the successful promotion of sustainable adoption requires the consistent parallel execution of three demand stimulation strategies-1.) wareness-building, 2.) development of relevant content, and 3.) and demand aggregation. The project will encompass several specific public needs for broadband service, including, but not limited to, education, employment, economic development, and enhanced service for health-care delivery, children, and vulnerable populations. When you look at the 'lack of broadband&quot; delima through the eyes of a rural community, it&#039;s typically the littlest ones who continue to go without, on all fronts. Of the 156 communities we&#039;re proposing to serve, for example, nearly half of those are less than 1,000 population. In the same communities you often find a host of economic, cultural and other factors which compound the disparity experience that is in play, making all basic daily needs, which today certainly includes broadband, even more dire. Our project is designed to remedy this disparity, assuring that these rural Mississippi residents have a meaningful place in line for all of the planned broadband and digital literacy training that CDL, and our collaboration partners, will be delivering.	-	-	-	-

STM&#039;s top priority is to help mayors get quality broadband access, together with thorough broadband orientation and training to all residents in smaller, typically 'broadband underserved&quot; communities across America. In Mississippi, STM proposes a unique regionally networked computing center model to bring affordable, fourth-generation broadband services to all residents across the area which covers over half of the state&#039;s counties and encompasses 156 communities and, at the time of the 2000 census, 676,984 of its citizens. STM&#039;s planning, broadband integration and operations for this network is managed by Community Development Leagues of America (CDL) which brings a track record and management team needed to deploy within 6-12 months, generate jobs, and coordinate with its other partners to ensure increased broadband adoption rates and sustainability across this region. When you look at the 'lack of broadband&quot; delima through the eyes of a rural municipality, it&#039;s typically the littlest ones who continue to go without, on all fronts. Of the 156 communities we&#039;re proposing to serve, for example, nearly half of those are less than 1,000 population. In the same communities you often find a host of economic, cultural and other factors which compound the disparity experience that is in play, making all basic daily needs, which today certainly includes broadband, even more dire. Our project is designed to remedy this disparity, by putting publically available broadband networked PCs and printers in each of our smaller communities first, assuring that they have a meaningful place in line for all of the planned broadband and digital literacy training that STM, and our collaboration partners, will be delivering across this network.	-	-	-	-
